### The Game Of Life

### Building
To build you need JDK 11, RedHat's OpenJDK or Oracle's JDK should both work fine, 
however OpenJDK is what I will be using and what is used for Semaphore Builds. 
Optionally you may also want to install Intellij IDEA Community.

The easiest way to build and run is using `bash run.sh` in the terminal.

You could alternatively use Intellij and select jar from `Gradle Tasks->Build->jar`, and once
you've done this step you can simply build by pressing the green run arrow at the top.

The jar will built so that all dependencies will be packed into it in order to make it easily portable.
